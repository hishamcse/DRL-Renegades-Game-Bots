recording videos.\n\nWe're using the [RL-Baselines-3 Zoo integration, a vanilla version of Deep Q-Learning](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/dqn.html) with no extensions such

focus on learning and experimenting without worrying about the technical aspects of setting up your environments**.\n\nTo validate this hands-on for the certification process, you need to push your trained model to the Hub and **get a result of >= 200**.\n\nTo find your result, go to the leaderboard and find your model, **the result = mean_reward - std of reward**\n\nFor more information about

S` or `File > Save a copy in Google Drive.`\n\nAlso, we're going to **train it for 90 minutes with 1M timesteps**. By typing `!nvidia-smi` will tell you what GPU you're using.\n\nAnd if you want to train more such 10 million steps, this will take about 9 hours, potentially resulting in Colab timing out.
